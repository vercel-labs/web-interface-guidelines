Interfaces succeed because of hundreds of choices. This is a living, non-exhaustive list of those decisions. Most guidelines are framework-agnostic, some specific to React/Next.js. [Feedback is welcome](https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/tree/main).

## Interactions

- **Keyboard works everywhere.** All flows are keyboard-operable & follow the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).
- **Clear focus.** Every focusable element shows a visible focus ring. Prefer `:focus-visible` over `:focus` to avoid distracting pointer users. Set `:focus-within` for grouped controls.
- **Manage focus.** Use focus traps, move & return focus according to the [WAI-ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).
- **Match visual & hit targets.** Exception: if the visual target is < 24px, expand its hit target to ≥ 24px. On mobile, the minimum size is 44px.
- **Mobile input size.** `<input>` font size is ≥ 16px on mobile to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom/pan on focus. Or set `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />`.
- **Respect zoom.** Never disable browser zoom.
- **Hydration-safe inputs.** Inputs must not lose focus or value after hydration.
- **Don’t block paste.** Never disable paste in `<input>` or `<textarea>`.
- **Loading buttons.** Show a loading indicator & keep the original label.
- **URL as state.** Persist state in the URL so share, refresh, and Back/Forward navigation work e.g., [nuqs](https://nuqs.47ng.com/).
- **Optimistic updates.** Update the UI immediately when success is likely; reconcile on server response. On failure, show an error and roll back or provide Undo.
- **Ellipsis for further input.** Menu options that open a follow-up e.g., “Rename…” end with an ellipsis.
- **Confirm destructive actions.** Require confirmation or provide Undo with a safe window.
- **Prevent double-tap zoom on controls.** Set `touch-action: manipulation`.
- **Tap highlight follows design.** Set `webkit-tap-highlight-color`.
- **Design forgiving interactions.** Controls minimize finickiness with generous hit targets, clear affordances, and predictable interactions, i.e., [prediction cones](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1657083267299028992).
- **Tooltip timing.** Delay the first tooltip in a group; [subsequent peers have no delay](https://x.com/emilkowalski_/status/1962500739336462340).
- **Overscroll behavior.** Set `overscroll-behavior: contain` intentionally e.g., in modals/drawers.
- **Scroll positions persist.** Back/Forward restores prior scroll.
- **Autofocus for speed.** On desktop screens with a single primary input, autofocus. Rarely autofocus on mobile because the keyboard opening can cause layout shift.
- **No dead zones.** If part of a control looks interactive, it should be interactive. Don’t leave users guessing where to interact.
- **Deep-link everything.** Filters, tabs, pagination, expanded panels, anytime `useState` is used.
- **Clean drag interactions.** Disable text selection & apply [`inert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inert) (which prevents interaction) while an element is dragged so selection/hover don't occur simultaneously.
- **Links are links.** Use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation so standard browser behaviors work (Cmd/Ctrl+Click, middle-click, right-click to open in a new tab). Never substitute with `<button>` or `<div>` for navigational links.
- **Announce async updates.** Use polite aria-live for toasts and inline validation.

## Animations

- **Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** Provide a reduced-motion variant.
- **Implementation preference.** Prefer CSS, avoid main-thread JS-driven animations when possible.
    - Preference: CSS > Web Animations API > Javascript libraries e.g., [motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/motion).
- **Compositor-friendly.** Prioritize GPU-accelerated properties (`transform`, `opacity`) & avoid properties that trigger reflows/repaints (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`).
- **Necessity check.** Only animate when it clarifies cause & effect or when it adds deliberate delight e.g., [the northern lights](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1831380516509278561).
- **Easing fits the subject.** Choose easing based on what changes (size, distance, trigger).
- **Interruptible.** Animations are cancelable by user input.
- **Input-driven.** Avoid autoplay; animate in response to actions.
- **Correct transform origin.** Anchor motion to where it “physically” starts.

## Layout

- **Optical alignment.** [Adjust ±1px](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1760444698857230360) when perception beats geometry.
- **Deliberate alignment.** Every element aligns with something intentionally whether to a grid, baseline, edge, or optical center. No accidental positioning.
- **Balance contrast in lockups.** When text & icons sit side by side, adjust weight, size, spacing, or color so they don’t clash. For example, a thin-stroke icon may need a bolder stroke next to medium-weight text.
- **Responsive coverage.** Verify on mobile, laptop, & ultra-wide. For ultra-wide, zoom out to 50% to simulate.
- **Respect safe areas.** Account for notches & insets with safe-area variables.
- **No excessive scrollbars.** Only render useful scrollbars; fix overflow issues to prevent unwanted scrollbars.

## Content

- **Inline help first.** Prefer inline explanations; use tooltips as a last resort.
- **Stable skeletons.** Skeletons mirror final content exactly to avoid layout shift.
- **Accurate page titles.** `<title>` reflects the current context.
- **No dead ends.** Every screen offers a next step or recovery path.
- **All states designed.** Empty, sparse, dense, & error states.
- **Typographic quotes.** Prefer curly quotes (“ ”) over straight quotes (" ").
- **Avoid widows/orphans.** Tidy rag & line breaks.
- **Tabular numbers for comparisons.** Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` or a monospace like [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font).
- **Redundant status cues.** Don’t rely on color alone; include text labels.
- **Icons have labels.** Convey the same meaning with text for non-sighted users.
- **Don’t ship the schema.** Visual layouts may omit visible labels, but accessible names/labels still exist for assistive tech.
- **Use the ellipsis character.** `…` over three periods `...`.
- **Anchored headings.** Set `scroll-margin-top` for headers when linking to sections.
- **Resilient to user-generated content.** Layouts handle short, average, & very long content.
- **Locale-aware formats.** Format dates, times, numbers, delimiters, & currencies for the user’s locale.
- **Accessible content.** Set accurate names (`aria-label`), hide decoration (`aria-hidden`), and verify in the [accessibility tree](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/full-accessibility-tree).
- **Icon-only buttons are named.** Provide a descriptive `aria-label`.
- **Semantics before ARIA.** Prefer native elements (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`), before `aria-*`.
- **Headings & skip link.** Hierarchical `<h1–h6>` & a “Skip to content” link.
- **Brand resources from the logo.** [Right-click the nav logo](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1636427186566762496) to surface brand assets for quick access.
- **Non-breaking spaces for glued terms.** Use a non-breaking space `&nbsp;` to keep units, shortcuts, and names together: `10 MB` → `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘ + K` → `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`, `Vercel SDK` → `Vercel&nbsp;SDK`.

## Forms

- **Enter submits.** When a text input is focused, Enter submits.
- **Textarea behavior.** In `<textarea>`, ⌘/⌃+Enter submits; Enter inserts a new line.
- **Labels everywhere.** Every control has a `<label>` or is associated with a label for assistive tech.
- **Label activation.** Clicking a `<label>` focuses the associated control.
- **Submission rule.** Keep submit enabled until submission starts; then disable during the in-flight request, show a spinner, & include an idempotency key.
- **Don’t block typing.** Even if a field only accepts numbers, allow any input & show validation feedback. Blocking keystrokes entirely is confusing because the user gets no explanation.
- **Don’t pre-disable submit.** Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation feedback.
- **No dead zones on controls.** Checkboxes & radios avoid dead zones; the label & control share a single generous hit target.
- **Error placement.** Show errors next to their fields; on submit, focus the first error.
- **Autocomplete & names.** Set `autocomplete` and meaningful `name` values to enable autofill.
- **Spellcheck selectively.** Disable for emails, codes, usernames, etc.
- **Correct types & input modes.** Use the right `type` & `inputmode` for better keyboards & validation.
- **Placeholders signal emptiness.** End with an ellipsis.
- **Placeholder value.** Set placeholder to an example value or pattern e.g., `+1 (123) 456-7890` & `sk-012345679…`
- **Unsaved changes.** Warn before navigation when data could be lost.
- **Password managers and 2FA.** Ensure compatibility and allow pasting one-time codes.
- **Text replacements and expansions.** Some add a trailing whitespace. The input should trim the value to avoid showing a confusing error message.

## Performance

- **Device/browser matrix.** Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari.
- **Measure reliably.** Disable extensions that add overhead or change runtime behavior.
- **Track re-renders.** Minimize & make re-renders fast. Use [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) or [React Scan](https://react-scan.com/).
- **Throttle when profiling.** Test with CPU and network throttling.
- **Minimize layout work.** Batch reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints.
- **Network latency budgets.** `POST/PATCH/DELETE` complete in <500ms.
- **Keystroke cost.** Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap.
- **Large lists.** Virtualize large lists e.g., [virtua](https://github.com/inokawa/virtua).
- **Preload wisely.** Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load the rest.
- **No image-caused CLS.** Set explicit image dimensions and reserve space.

## Design

- **Layered shadows.** Mimic ambient + direct light with at least two layers.
- **Crisp borders.** Combine borders and shadows; semi-transparent borders improve edge clarity.
- **Nested radii.** Child radius ≤ parent radius and concentric so curves align.
- **Hue consistency.** On non-neutral backgrounds, tint borders/shadows/text toward the same hue.
- **Accessible charts.** Use color-blind-friendly palettes.
- **Minimum contrast.** Prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrast.com/) over [WCAG 2](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) for more accurate perceptual contrast.
- **Interactions increase contrast.** `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus` have more contrast than  rest state.
- **Browser UI matches your background.** Set `<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">` to [align the browser’s theme color with the page background](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1816160187839107342).
- **Avoid gradient banding.** Some colors & display types will have color banding. [Masks can be used instead](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1724491202148675590).

# Vercel-specific

These preferences reflect Vercel’s brand and product choices. They aren’t universal guidelines.

## Copywriting

- **Active voice.**
    - Instead of “*The CLI will be installed,”* say *“Install the CLI.”*
- **Headings & buttons use Title Case** ([Chicago](https://title.sh/)). On marketing pages, use sentence case.
- **Be clear & concise.** Use as few words as possible.
- **Prefer `&` over `and`.**
- **Action-oriented language.**
    - Instead of *“You will need the CLI…”* say *“Install the CLI…”*.
- **Keep nouns consistent.** Introduce as few unique terms as possible.
- **Write in second person.** Avoid first person.
- **Use consistent placeholders.**
    - Strings: `YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE`. Numbers: `0123456789`.
- **Use numerals for counts.**
    - Instead of *“eight deployments”* say *“8 deployments”*.
- **Consistent currency formatting.** In any given context, display currency with either 0 or 2 decimal places, never mix both.
- **Separate numbers & units with a space.**
    - Instead of `10MB` say `10 MB`.
    - Use a non-breaking space e.g., `10&nbsp;MB`.
- **Default to positive language.** Frame messages in an encouraging, problem-solving way, even for errors.
    - Instead of *“Your deployment failed,”* say *“Something went wrong—try again or contact support.”*
- **Error messages guide the exit.** Don’t just state what went wrong—tell the user how to fix it.
    - Instead of *“Invalid API key,”* say *“Your API key is incorrect or expired. Generate a new key in your account settings.”* The copy & buttons/links should educate & give a clear action.
- **Avoid ambiguity.** Labels are clear & specific.
    - Instead of the button label *“Continue”* say *“Save API Key”*.
